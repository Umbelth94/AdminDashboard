# AdminDashboard
Admin Dashboard project via The Odin Project

# Learning Goals
I will be utilizing this project to practice using CSS grid to make a responsive format for various screen sizes (and eventually mobile).

# Post-Project Reflection
The original intention was to use Grid for everything that I could for positioning elements on the page.  I quickly caved and ended up using Flexbox for solving specific positioning issues that arose when I needed to start aligning actual content within the elements.  I'm fine with this, as it is more practical and will likely be the best way to do it in future projects.

Outside of that, I also experimented with a few different ways to position/add icons into my content.  On the side bar, I used an outside library called Font Awesome that allowed me to use their toolkit to add icons directly into the HTML.  I utilized this for the icons at the bottom of the content cards as well.  With the header, I used downloaded icons and image elements to style and size them via css.  Overall, the Font Awesome toolkit was very useful, and I'm fine with having used it as it just saved me some time via workflow and avoided me having to download a bunch more image assets.
